# DQN_SnakeGame
Training a Deep Q Learning Network to play the classic game Snake. Utilized JavaScript to design the game, Python and Selenium for agent interactions, and leveraged Pytorch for efficient training.

# This Project is Still Under Construction

There are several issues with the script that I'm aware of and currently working on:
- The agent does not show any signs of learning as intended
- There are instances where the end-game alert does not trigger the exception that ends the game and restarts the loop
- "Element not interactable" error. Not clear on the cause. I'm currently using a workaround but I need to find a solution

I will be writing a blog post about my thought process and how it all went down, but for now, I will include a copy of my project notes [here.](https://github.com/PaigeCrossley/DQN_SnakeGame/blob/main/Project%20Notes.pdf)

The Images folder contains examples of preprocessed screemshots and images after cropping, resizing and being made grayscale.

The Graphs folder contains graphs from some of the runs I've completed so far.
